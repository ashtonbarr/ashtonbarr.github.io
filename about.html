            <p style="font-family: 'Arial';">I am in my third year at university, studying at Australian Catholic University. My degree is a double, in which I am studying a Bachelor of Education (Secondary)/Bachelor of Arts (Design innovations and Technology). During my degree I have identified my major, industrial timber, and my minor, food technology. I am in the process of designing and creating my major work which is due at the conclusion of the semester. As I am in my third year, I have completed three placements, two at public schools and one at a Catholic school, providing me with a range of skills, understanding, and resources for my professional career. </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Arial';">Although I do spend majority of my time at university and work, I have a range of hobbies that I do in my spare time, as well as make time to do them. I enjoy going to the gym and going on runs, as well as crocheting. I am currently training for a half marathon and completing a range of crochet projects. By creating and sticking to a routine and spending time with loved ones, I am able to successfully manage my time.</p>
